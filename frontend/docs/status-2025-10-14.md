# Project Status â€“ 2025-10-14

## Overview
- LuckyWheel component renders correctly after type-only imports and typed refs.
- Customer name capture, stricter phone validation (0 + 9 digits), and coupon code generation wired into the spin flow.
- Backend proxy helpers hardened with stricter typing, optional mock mode, signed payloads, and support for the `lucky-wheel` auth header.

## Build & Tooling
- `npm run lint` :white_check_mark:
- `npm run build` :white_check_mark: (warning: current Node 18.16.0, Vite recommends >= 20.19)
- Mock API toggle via `VITE_USE_MOCK_API=true` for offline testing.
- Real webhook requires `VITE_SPIN_ENDPOINT` (https URL) + `VITE_WEBHOOK_TOKEN`; otherwise flow stays in mock mode automatically.
- Debug logging controllable with `VITE_DEBUG_LOGS=true` (auto-on in dev).

## Next Focus
- Upgrade local Node runtime to satisfy Vite's minimum requirement.
- Provide `.env` values (`VITE_BACKEND_URL`, `VITE_WEBHOOK_TOKEN`) for the production webhook and disable mock mode once verified.
- Add unit/integration tests once backend endpoints stabilize.
